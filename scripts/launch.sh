# scripts/launch.sh -- the ONE correct way to start a WarpX run in this repo.
#
# Ported from KinShock2020/scripts/launch.sh, with one addition: this project runs
# BOTH 1D and 2D, so the WarpX binary is chosen from the run's `geometry.dims`
# instead of being hard-coded to warpx.1d.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. The generated deck sets no `diag*.file_prefix`, so WarpX
# writes plotfiles to `diags/` RELATIVE TO THE LAUNCH CWD. Launching two runs from
# the repo root makes them share ./diags/ and clobber each other (WarpX leaves
# .old.NNNN rename files as the tell) -- that cost a rerun of two control runs in
# KinShock2020 (RESULTS 2026-07-26). This script always cd's into the run dir first,
# so diag1/diag_fields/reducedfiles/laserdep_profile_* land under runs/<ID>/diags/.
#
# Also applies the benchmarked thread settings (KinShock2020 RESULTS 2026-07-23:
# near-linear to 8 cores, ~1.8x vs 4, memory-bandwidth-bound beyond; max_grid_size,
# tiling and sort_intervals were neutral-to-negative -- don't bother).
#
# Usage:  scripts/launch.sh [options] <run_dir> [-- <warpx args>]
#
#   -j, --threads N    OMP_NUM_THREADS (default 8)
#   -w, --warpx PATH   WarpX binary (default: $LPS_WARPX, else picked from geometry.dims)
#   -b, --background   detach and return immediately (prints the PID)
#   -L, --logger       also start scripts/run_progress_logger.py in the background
#   -f, --force        launch even though diags/ already holds output (see below)
#   -n, --dry-run      print what would run, change nothing
#
# Anything after `--` is appended as ParmParse overrides, e.g.
#   scripts/launch.sh runs/P0_bc_1d -- max_step=20
# NOTE overrides are not reflected in config.yaml, so `make_inputs.py --verify` will
# flag them afterwards. Use them for smoke tests, not for physics.
#
# Stdout/stderr go to <run_dir>/run.log (gitignored; findings belong in RESULTS.md).
#
# Refuses to start when diags/ is already populated, because relaunching overwrites a
# finished run's plotfiles in place -- pass --force once you mean it, or move the old
# diags/ aside. Run `make_inputs.py <run_dir> --check` first if the deck may be stale.

# RESULTS.md — LaserProdShock lab notebook

**One dated entry per substantive run or finding.** This is how context survives between
sessions; read it first to learn current state. Newest entries at the bottom.

Conventions: quote densities in `n_cr`, lengths in `d_e,ref` (say which), speeds in `c` or
`v_A` (say which), times in `ω_ci0⁻¹` for shock runs and `ω_pe⁻¹`/ps for ablation runs.
Report the gates (G1–G7, `TEST_PLAN.md` §6) for every run. **Retractions get their own
dated entry** — do not silently edit an earlier one.

## 2026-07-28 — Project created; inherited state

Repository scaffolded as a sibling of `KinShock2020`, following its architecture: config as
single source of truth, `scripts/launch.sh` as the only launcher, sidecar progress logger,
per-run `README.md` (newly enforced by `launch.sh`).

**Built and working**: `scripts/launch.sh` (ported; now picks `warpx.1d`/`warpx.2d` from
`geometry.dims`, and refuses to launch a run with no `README.md`),
`scripts/run_progress_logger.py` (ported; additionally parses the operator's `LASERDEP`
lines and reports `Pabs` as a fraction of its running peak, so the **self-limiting
absorption shutoff** is visible live).

**Not built**: everything else — `src/laserprod/*`, `make_inputs.py`, `run_checks.py`,
`laser_report.py`, `phase_space.py`, `tune_shock.py`, `make_figures.py`, `make_movies.py`,
`sweep.py`. That is Phase 0 (`TEST_PLAN.md` §5.1, §11).

**Inherited from `warpx-cda/laser_deposition/`** (not to be re-derived — `TEST_PLAN.md`
§1.1). The operator is validated against analytic IB/WKB theory to 0.02–1.6 % across five
CI tests plus eight research-scale accuracy runs: uniform-slab deposition profile exact to
0.000 % in cells 2…510, ramp profile overlaying the closed form across 8 decades with the
turning point at the analytic position, `z_m` tracking `z_crit cos²θ₀` to ~1 cell out to
60°, and a coefficient audit flat to 1e-5 over a 275× range of `K` (exponents
2.018 / 0.9999 / 0.9999 / −1.4999 / 2.028 on `n_e`, `Z_eff`, `lnΛ`, `T_e`, `I`). Local-`T_e`
mode tracks an imposed 10× ramp to 0.05 %. PSC cross-validation (Test C) is blocked
upstream: Hyder et al.'s PSC ray-tracing module is not public.

**Three inherited open issues**, carried into this project's gates:
1. **Exit-boundary overshoot** — the ray takes a partial extra arc-length step past the far
   boundary and *creates* energy in the final cell (+24.9 % at default `ray_cfl`). ≤ 0.04 %
   of total absorption upstream, but a vacuum-ablation target sits near that boundary.
2. **`ray_cfl = 0.25` is not asymptotic** for turning-point problems (non-monotonic
   convergence, default near a 2.5 % excursion). Uniform slabs are exact at any `ray_cfl`.
3. **`coulomb_log` is a fixed input**, so the model is not fully self-consistent — though
   logarithmically, not as a power law.

**The retracted shock claim** (`warpx-cda/laser_deposition/run_laser_shock/`, RESULTS there
2026-07-27) is the campaign's motivating result and is treated as established:
compression ~2 in `B` and `n_e` with a real diamagnetic cavity and a front at 2.63 `v_A`
were **not** a shock. Phase space showed 0.00 % ion reflection, upstream/downstream
`f(u_z)` differing only by a −0.83 `v_A` shift and 0.56 → 0.72 `v_A` broadening, and a
piston at only ~1 `v_A` — *slower than the compression it had launched*, and subsonic at
`v_ms = 1.15 v_A`. It was a freely-propagating fast magnetosonic pulse from a genuine
laser-driven ablation. Hence the third project rule: **phase space decides what is a
shock.** The identified fix, to be the starting point for `P2_mag`: lower `B₀` to ~100 T
*and* the ambient electron temperature to `θ = 5×10⁻⁴` (the ambient sound speed was
0.57 `v_A` and dominates `v_ms` once `B₀` drops, so `B₀` alone buys little) → `M_ms ≈ 2.6`.

**Also inherited as hard constraints**: `ω_pe dt < 2` is the binding stability limit and the
grid CFL cannot see it (`cfl = 0.75` → `ω_pe dt = 1.91` initially, 2.43 after the target
self-compressed, 21× spurious energy growth, everything past `t ≈ 0.1 ω_ci0⁻¹` invalid);
periodic fields force periodic particles, so a 0.20 c runaway ablation front wraps and
pollutes the upstream and **no vacuum gap is large enough**; `Z_eff·lnΛ` 25 → 91 coupled
**16×** more energy. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full list.

**Derived for this project** (`TEST_PLAN.md` §2.1, `OVERVIEW.md` §3): at λ₀ = 1.053 µm,
`n_cr = 1.005×10²⁷ m⁻³` and `d_e,cr = c/ω₀ = λ₀/2π = 0.1676 µm` exactly. Two consequences
worth having on record:
- **Schaeffer's Table I densities are natural for a 1 µm laser** — the ablation density
  6×10²⁰ cm⁻³ is 0.6 `n_cr`, the upstream 4.8×10¹⁸ cm⁻³ is 0.0048 `n_cr`. The absolute
  scale is not the obstacle; the ~125:1 contrast is.
- **`ρ_i0 ≈ 65 d_e,amb`** for the `run_laser_shock` parameters (`B₀ = 74.7 T`,
  `ω_ci0⁻¹ = 7.61 ps`, `v_p = 0.0196 c` → `ρ_i0 = 44.7 µm`), versus ~1040 `d_e` in
  `KinShock2020`'s `R1_*`, because `B₀` is large relative to the density. A transverse
  extent of ~1 `ρ_i0` is therefore only ~65 cells at `dz = 0.5 d_e` — **a genuinely 2D
  magnetized laser-driven shock is affordable here**, which is why 2D is in the plan as
  physics rather than as a smoke test.
- Corollary flagged as gate G2: the cold 1.5 `n_cr` target is Debye-under-resolved by
  **~250×** (vs ~7 for the ambient) at `dz = 0.5 d_e,amb`. Unavoidable on one uniform grid
  with no AMR, which is why the **laser-off control (G3)** is mandatory for every headline
  run rather than optional.

Next: Phase 0 (`TEST_PLAN.md` §5) — finalise the config schema, build
`units`/`config`/`deck` + `make_inputs.py` + `run_checks.py` + `laser_report.py`, then the
five short boundary runs, ending in a recorded decision on the default boundary
configuration.
